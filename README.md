## Overview

This project builds and compares machine learning models to predict recidivism and the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. The goal is to support better targeting of rehabilitation services and reduce repeated incarceration.

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo and create a virtual environment**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msomakpo/recidivism-risk-prediction/tree/main
cd recidivism-risk-prediction
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the main notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/recidivism_analysis.ipynb

## Ethical Considerations

Predictive models in criminal justice risk reinforcing systemic biases. This project incorporates fairness-aware metrics, interpretable modeling, and error analysis to identify and mitigate unintended consequences. Responsible implementation remains essential.
