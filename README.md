## 📊 Overview

This project builds and compares machine learning models to predict recidivism — the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. The goal is to support better targeting of rehabilitation services and reduce repeated incarceration.

---

## 📦 Setup

1. **Clone the repo and create a virtual environment**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msomakpo/recidivism-risk-prediction/tree/main
cd recidivism-risk-prediction
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the main notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/recidivism_analysis.ipynb
---

## 🧪 Line Testing

> *Note: A placeholder test file `test_rehab_model.py` is referenced but was not created for this version. Future iterations should include unit tests for feature engineering and model validation.*

## 🔍 Error Analysis Summary

Error analysis on the XGBoost model revealed that false negatives (missed reoffenders) were most concentrated among younger individuals in District 10. False positives were common for high-frequency offense types. These patterns informed fairness discussions and underscore the value of including more context-aware features like rehabilitation program completion or district-level support access.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

Predictive models in criminal justice risk reinforcing systemic biases. This project incorporates fairness-aware metrics, interpretable modeling, and error analysis to identify and mitigate unintended consequences. Responsible implementation remains essential.
